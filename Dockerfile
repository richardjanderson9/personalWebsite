#  Author: Richard Anderson.
#  Last Updated: 25-Sep-2026.
#  Version: 1.1.2
#  Note: Uses dynamic Node 22 and Nginx unprivileged Alpine base images.
#

# ==========================================
# Stage 1: Build Stage
# ==========================================
# Uses the latest dynamic Node 22 Alpine image
FROM node:22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies first to optimize Docker's layer caching.
# package files are copied independently so dependencies aren't re-installed on every source code change.
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci && npm cache clean --force

# Copy the rest of the source code and trigger the production build.
# Note: Vite is configured to output compiled assets to the 'build/' directory.
COPY . .
RUN npm run build


# ==========================================
# Stage 2: Production Stage
# ==========================================
# Uses the latest official Nginx unprivileged Alpine image running as a non-root 'nginx' user
FROM nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:alpine

# Copy the compiled static assets from the build stage into Nginx's public web directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx routing and server configuration over the default template
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Document and expose port 8080 (Unprivileged system ports must be > 1024)
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Nginx in the foreground so container lifecycle management works properly
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
